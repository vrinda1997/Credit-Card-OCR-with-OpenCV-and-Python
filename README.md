# Credit-Card-OCR-with-OpenCV-and-Python
This project demonstrates how a template matching algorithm as a form of OCR help us create a solution to automatically recognize credit cards and extract the associated credit card digits from images.
Here we devise a computer vision and image processing algorithm that can:
1.  Localize the four groupings of four digits on a credit card.
2.  Extract each of these four groupings followed by segmenting each of the sixteen numbers individually.
3.  Recognize each of the sixteen credit card digits by using template matching and the OCR-A font.
